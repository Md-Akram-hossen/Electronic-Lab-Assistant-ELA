My thesis focuses on developing an AI-powered Electronics Laboratory Assistant capable of managing a wide range of lab-related tasks. The system integrates advanced voice and vision capabilities to interact naturally with students and support laboratory operations. Key functionalities include:

Managing and tracking electronic components with secure access control

Communicating with students through speech and visual recognition

Sending emails, taking notes, and scheduling appointments autonomously

Real-time learning of new faces and laboratory items

Smart-home style environmental control within the lab

Data collection and monitoring for improved lab management

Multimedia support, such as weather updats, multiple timer setup even playing music when needed
